1) Note that I assume you already know how to apply effects to a model.
2) In the MMEffects tab within MikuMikuDance, open the Map Effect File
window and find the name of the model you want to edit
3) Right-click on it and select "Subset-Extract"
4)You will see a list of materials appear under the object. Apply the
following effects to each material (the normal-mapping effects are found 
in the same folder containing the model's textures):

For SONIC THE HEDGEHOG:

Body; Eyelids Upper; Eyelids Bottom; Mouth Left; Mouth Right -> body.fx
Clothes -> clothes.fx
Eyes -> eyes.fx
Shoes -> shoes.fx
